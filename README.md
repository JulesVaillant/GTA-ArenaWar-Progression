# GTA-ArenaWar-Progression
A short Python program that shows your progression in Arena War

# :1234: Calculations
The calculations are based on the "[Arena Points](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Arena_Points#Rewards)" on the GTA Wiki page. <br/>
The accumulative amount of AP required to reach rank n can be expressed as:

<div align="center"><strong>5n<sup>2</sup>+45n</strong></div> <br/>
  
 For example, the total amount of AP required to reach level 200 is:
<div align="center"><strong>5×200<sup>2</sup>+45×200 = 209k AP</strong></div> <br/>
  
  # :computer: Install and run
  To run the program, Python 3.10.10 or newer is required (should work on older versions but too lazy to try out). <br/> 
  You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) for Windows users, [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) for MacOS users.
